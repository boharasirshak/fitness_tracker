# Fitness Tracker
A fitness tracker application that allows users to record themselves and track their workout progress over time.
This project is built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL and MediaPipe.

## Features
### 1. User authentication
Authorization with JWT.

### 2. Workout recording
Record workout videos and get the number of reps, correctness of form and time taken for each exercise.

### 3. Workout tracking
Track workout progress over time and view statistics.

## Note
- > The entire frontend is made using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frontend framework is used to keep everything simple, fast and efficient. 

- > If the project grows in complexity, a frontend framework like React is advised to use because pure JS is hard to maintain. 

- > For that the FastAPI should server as API only, and React frontend should be hosted separately.
